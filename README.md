# Taalmaatje

Taalmaatje doesn't use frameworks, the only thing it uses is GULP


Gulp in this case is used to:
- Compile SASS into CSS
- Compress JS files

## Getting started

1. CD into the *"taalmaatje"* folder
2. Install the node modules
```
$ npm install
```

3. Start using gulp
```
$ gulp
```
